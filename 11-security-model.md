# Chapter 11: Security Model

## Security by Design

WebAssembly was designed with security as a primary goal. Unlike native code or JavaScript, WASM runs in a hardened sandbox that provides:

- **Memory isolation** - Can't access memory it doesn't own
- **Type safety** - No type confusion attacks
- **Control flow integrity** - No arbitrary jumps or code injection
- **Capability-based security** - Explicit grants, not ambient authority
- **No undefined behavior** - Everything is well-defined

These guarantees are **enforced by the specification**. A conforming WASM engine must provide these protections.

## The Sandbox

### What the Sandbox Prevents

WASM code **cannot**:

- Access memory outside its linear memory
- Call functions not explicitly imported
- Access the file system directly
- Open network sockets directly
- Access the DOM directly (in browsers)
- Execute arbitrary machine code
- Forge function pointers
- Bypass type checking
- Escape the sandbox

Everything a WASM module does must go through explicit imports or its own linear memory.

### What the Sandbox Allows

WASM code **can**:

- Read and write its own linear memory
- Call imported functions (with host permission)
- Call its own functions
- Manipulate tables and globals
- Grow memory (within limits)
- Perform computation

All capabilities must be explicitly granted by the host.

## Memory Isolation

### Linear Memory is Sandboxed

Each WASM instance has its own linear memory. Instance A cannot access instance B's memory unless they explicitly share it via imports/exports.

```wasm
;; Instance A
(memory 1)
```

```wasm
;; Instance B
(memory 1)
```

These are **separate** memory spaces. No cross-instance access is possible.

### Bounds Checking

Every memory access is bounds-checked:

```wasm
i32.const 1000000  ;; Address beyond current memory
i32.load           ;; TRAP: out of bounds
```

There's no way to:
- Read beyond memory bounds
- Write beyond memory bounds
- Overflow a buffer to corrupt other memory

Bounds checks are mandatory. Engines may optimize them (e.g., using guard pages), but the safety guarantee remains.

### No Pointer Forgery

In WASM, pointers are just i32 indices into linear memory. You can compute any address, but you can't:

- Access memory outside the linear memory
- Access other instances' memory
- Access the host's memory

```wasm
i32.const -1       ;; Wraps to 0xFFFFFFFF
i32.load           ;; TRAP: out of bounds (assuming memory is smaller)
```

Even if you compute an arbitrary integer, bounds checking prevents escaping the sandbox.

## Type Safety

### Static Type Checking

WASM is statically typed. Every operation is type-checked at validation time:

```wasm
i32.const 5
f64.const 2.5
i32.add           ;; Error: i32.add expects [i32, i32], got [i32, f64]
```

Invalid modules are rejected before they run.

### No Type Confusion

You can't trick the type system:

```wasm
;; Can't treat a number as a function reference
i32.const 42
call_indirect     ;; Error: expects funcref, got i32
```

Function references (funcref) and data (i32/i64/f32/f64) are distinct. You can't forge a function pointer by manipulating integers.

### No Buffer Overflow Exploits

In C, buffer overflows can overwrite return addresses:

```c
char buffer[10];
strcpy(buffer, very_long_string);  // Overflow!
```

In WASM:

```wasm
;; Writing beyond bounds traps
i32.const 10      ;; Address beyond buffer
i32.const 42
i32.store         ;; TRAP: bounds check
```

Even if the bounds check somehow failed (it can't in a correct implementation), there are no return addresses in memoryâ€”they're in the VM's control structures, inaccessible to WASM.

## Control Flow Integrity

### Structured Control Flow

WASM doesn't have `goto` or arbitrary jumps. All control flow is structured:

```wasm
(block $label
  ;; Can only branch to $label
  br $label
)
```

You can't:
- Jump into the middle of a block
- Jump to an arbitrary address
- Overwrite return addresses

### Return Address Protection

Return addresses aren't stored in linear memory. They're managed by the VM. There's no way to manipulate them from WASM code.

### No Code Injection

You can't write executable code to memory and execute it. Linear memory is data-only. Code comes from the module's code section, which is immutable.

```wasm
;; Can't do this:
i32.const 0
;; Write machine code bytes to memory
i32.const 0x90909090
i32.store
;; Try to execute it (impossible in WASM)
```

Code and data are strictly separated.

## Capability-Based Security

### Principle of Least Privilege

WASM follows capability-based security: a module can only do what it's explicitly granted permission to do.

Want to log to console?

```wasm
(import "console" "log" (func $log (param i32)))
```

The host must provide this import. Without it, the module has no console access.

Want to access the file system?

```wasm
(import "wasi_snapshot_preview1" "fd_read" (func $fd_read ...))
```

The host provides (or denies) this capability.

### No Ambient Authority

Unlike traditional programs, WASM modules don't have ambient authority. They can't:

- Access environment variables (unless imported)
- Read files (unless file handles are provided)
- Make network requests (unless socket capabilities are granted)
- Access system APIs directly

Every capability is explicit and controllable.

### Capability Attenuation

The host can provide restricted capabilities:

```javascript
// Full console access
const fullImports = {
  console: {
    log: console.log,
    error: console.error,
    warn: console.warn
  }
};

// Restricted: only logging
const restrictedImports = {
  console: {
    log: console.log,
    error: () => {},  // No-op
    warn: () => {}    // No-op
  }
};

// No console access
const noImports = {};
```

The module works within whatever it's given.

## Validation and Guarantees

### Validation is Mandatory

Before a WASM module can execute, it must be validated:

1. **Type checking** - All operations have correct types
2. **Stack balancing** - Functions leave the stack in the expected state
3. **Control flow** - Blocks are well-nested, branches target valid labels
4. **Memory/table bounds** - Indices are valid at declaration time
5. **Constant expressions** - Initializers are valid constant expressions

Invalid modules are **rejected**. They never execute.

### No Undefined Behavior

Unlike C/C++, WASM has no undefined behavior. Everything is specified:

- **Integer overflow** - Wraps (defined behavior)
- **Division by zero** - Traps (well-defined error)
- **Out-of-bounds access** - Traps
- **Uninitialized variables** - Locals are zero-initialized
- **Invalid function calls** - Type-checked, trap if signature doesn't match

If something would be undefined in C, WASM either defines it or makes it trap.

## Attack Surface and Mitigations

### Side-Channel Attacks

WASM doesn't prevent all side-channel attacks:

**Timing attacks** - Code execution time can leak information:

```wasm
;; Time taken reveals password length
(func $check_password (param $input_ptr i32) (param $len i32) (result i32)
  ;; Compare byte-by-byte, return early on mismatch
  ;; Timing reveals first incorrect byte position
)
```

**Mitigation**: Use constant-time algorithms when needed.

**Spectre/Meltdown** - Speculative execution can leak data.

**Mitigation**: Engines may disable shared memory or use site isolation.

### Resource Exhaustion

WASM code can consume resources:

**Infinite loops:**

```wasm
(loop $forever
  br $forever
)
```

**Mitigation**: Host can timeout execution or provide a watchdog.

**Memory exhaustion:**

```wasm
(loop $alloc
  i32.const 1
  memory.grow
  br $alloc
)
```

**Mitigation**: Set memory limits, monitor growth.

### Integer Overflow

Integer overflow wraps in WASM (like C's unsigned):

```wasm
i32.const 0x7FFFFFFF  ;; INT_MAX
i32.const 1
i32.add               ;; 0x80000000 (wraps to negative in signed interpretation)
```

**Mitigation**: Use wider types, check for overflow manually if needed.

### Denial of Service

Malicious modules can cause DoS:

```wasm
;; Allocate maximum memory
i32.const 1000000
memory.grow

;; Infinite loop
(loop br 0)
```

**Mitigation**: Resource limits, timeouts, monitoring.

## Trust Boundaries

### Trusted: The WASM Engine

The engine (browser, wasmtime, wasmer) is trusted to:

- Correctly implement the specification
- Enforce sandboxing
- Validate modules
- Perform bounds checking

If the engine has bugs, security breaks. This is why engines are heavily audited.

### Untrusted: WASM Modules

WASM modules are untrusted. They're assumed to be potentially malicious. The sandbox must contain them.

### Trusted: Host Imports

Imports are provided by the host and are trusted. If the host provides a file access import, that's a security decision by the host.

## WASI Security Model

WASI (WebAssembly System Interface) extends capability-based security to system calls:

**File system access:**

```bash
wasmtime --dir=/tmp mymodule.wasm
```

The module can only access /tmp, not the entire filesystem.

**Network access:**

Some WASI implementations allow granular network permissions:

```bash
wasmtime --allow-network=https://api.example.com mymodule.wasm
```

WASI enables sandboxed system programs with fine-grained capabilities.

## Browser-Specific Security

### Same-Origin Policy

In browsers, WASM modules respect the same-origin policy. They can't:

- Load modules from other origins without CORS
- Access other origins' data

### Content Security Policy

WASM loading can be controlled via CSP:

```http
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval'
```

`'wasm-unsafe-eval'` is required for `WebAssembly.compile()` in some CSP modes.

### Cross-Origin Isolation

For some features (SharedArrayBuffer, high-resolution timers), the page must be cross-origin isolated:

```http
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
```

This prevents certain side-channel attacks.

## Security Best Practices

### For Module Authors

1. **Validate inputs** - Don't trust data from imports
2. **Use bounds-checked access** - Even though WASM enforces it, be explicit
3. **Avoid timing leaks** - Use constant-time algorithms for secrets
4. **Limit resource usage** - Don't allocate unbounded memory
5. **Handle errors gracefully** - Don't assume imports always succeed

### For Host Developers

1. **Minimize imports** - Provide only necessary capabilities
2. **Validate module sources** - Only load modules from trusted origins
3. **Set resource limits** - Limit memory, execution time
4. **Monitor resource usage** - Watch for DoS attempts
5. **Audit imported modules** - Review third-party WASM
6. **Use isolation** - Run untrusted modules in separate processes if possible

### For WASM Consumers

1. **Load from trusted sources** - Verify module integrity
2. **Use subresource integrity** - In browsers, use SRI hashes
3. **Audit dependencies** - Review what modules do
4. **Update engines regularly** - Security patches matter
5. **Enable security features** - Use CSP, COEP, COOP appropriately

## Real-World Security Considerations

### Running Untrusted Code

WASM is designed for this. Examples:

- **Code playgrounds** - Run user-submitted code safely
- **Plugin systems** - Third-party plugins can't escape
- **Serverless functions** - Isolate customer code

The sandbox makes this feasible.

### Cryptography

WASM is suitable for crypto:

- No undefined behavior
- Type safety prevents many bugs
- Constant-time operations are possible

But watch for:

- Timing side-channels
- Speculative execution leaks
- Insufficient randomness (need host import for random)

### Smart Contracts

Blockchain platforms use WASM for smart contracts:

- **Determinism** - WASM execution is deterministic
- **Isolation** - Contracts can't interfere with each other
- **Gas metering** - Track execution cost

WASM's security model is critical here.

## Limitations

WASM's security model doesn't protect against:

- **Logical bugs** - A module can have business logic flaws
- **Data exfiltration via imports** - If you import a "sendToServer" function, the module can use it
- **Social engineering** - Malicious modules can be designed to trick users
- **Host vulnerabilities** - Bugs in the host environment

WASM provides a sandbox, not a magic security solution.

## Future Enhancements

Proposals that improve security:

**Memory64** - 64-bit memory addressing with larger address space

**Type imports/exports** - Better interfaces between modules

**GC proposal** - Managed memory for high-level languages, reduces memory corruption risk

**Component model** - Better encapsulation and composition

## Auditing and Verification

Tools for analyzing WASM modules:

**wasm-validate** - Check module validity

```bash
wasm-validate module.wasm
```

**wasm-objdump** - Inspect module contents

```bash
wasm-objdump -x module.wasm
```

**Decompilers** - Convert WASM to readable format (wasm2wat)

**Static analysis** - Custom tools to check for specific patterns

## Incident Response

If a malicious module is detected:

1. **Terminate execution** - Kill the instance
2. **Revoke capabilities** - Remove host imports
3. **Analyze the module** - Decompile, inspect bytecode
4. **Update filters** - Block known-malicious modules
5. **Patch vulnerabilities** - If an engine bug was exploited

## Conclusion

WebAssembly's security model is comprehensive:

- **Sandboxing** prevents escape
- **Type safety** prevents confusion attacks
- **Memory isolation** prevents cross-instance attacks
- **Capability-based security** enables principle of least privilege
- **Validation** ensures only safe modules run

Combined, these make WASM one of the safest execution environments for untrusted code. Understanding the security guaranteesâ€”and their limitsâ€”is essential for building secure systems with WebAssembly.

## Next Steps

We've completed Part 2, covering runtime and execution. In Part 3, we'll explore the toolchain and ecosystemâ€”compilers, runtimes, WASI, debugging, and testing. Understanding the tools is key to productively developing with WebAssembly.
