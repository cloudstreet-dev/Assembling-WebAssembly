# Assembling WebAssembly

A comprehensive guide to building WebAssembly from multiple programming languages. This book is designed for advanced developers who want to master WASM across web, server, embedded, and edge computing contexts.

## About This Book

This book assumes you already know the programming languages we'll be using. Our focus is on teaching you WebAssembly itselfâ€”how to compile to it, optimize for it, and deploy it effectively across different environments.

**Status**: Complete - All 52 chapters written, covering foundations through advanced topics to real-world practice projects.

## How to Read This Book

- **Sequential reading**: Parts 1-3 build foundational knowledge. Read these in order.
- **Language chapters**: Pick the languages relevant to your work (Parts 4-5).
- **Context-based reading**: Choose Part 6 (Web), Part 7 (Server), or Part 8 (Embedded) based on your deployment target.
- **Advanced readers**: Parts 9-10 can be read independently once you understand the foundations.

## Prerequisites

This book assumes:
- Strong programming background in at least one systems or application language
- Familiarity with concepts like memory management, types, and compilation
- Basic understanding of how code executes on hardware
- No prior WASM knowledge required
